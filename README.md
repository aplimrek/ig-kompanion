# IG Clone - Kompanion

This is a case study project for the job applicaton on Kompanion

## Issues

- For the image loading and caching, i thought that it would be unneccessary to write native module for each platform. Since it uses Glide for Android and SDWebImage for iOS, i prefer to use react-native-fast-image package. But it does not support the newest version of react (18.0.0) like most of the packeges. I sent a pull request but it was not approved yet. So, we have to use --force option while installing the npm packages.

- For the video component, i prefer to use react-native-video. But the newest version has a lot of performance issue. The community suggest the prevÄ±ous version (5.2.0) but the react removes one of the dependencies of this version. So, i used a PR that fixes this issue.
